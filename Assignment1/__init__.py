"""
des_library — A reusable Discrete Event Simulation toolkit.

Core classes
    Simulation          Event-driven simulation engine (no global state).
    Event               Base class for all events.
    StopSimulation      Event that terminates the run.

Statistics
    TimeWeightedStatistic   Time-weighted average (e.g. queue length).
    SampleStatistic         Running mean / variance / CI over samples.
    Counter                 Simple counter with rate helpers.

Distributions
    Deterministic, Exponential, Erlang, Uniform, Normal, Sequence
